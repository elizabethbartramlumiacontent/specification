Historic parks and gardens are listed in the [Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/registered-parks-and-gardens/). They intend to protect significant land that has been designed rather than natural land. 

### Why are they important for planning?

Planning authorities must consider the impact of any proposed development on the park or garden’s special character and must consult Historic England where a planning application affects a Grade I or II* registered park or garden or battlefield. They will also consult the Gardens Trust on all applications affecting registered parks or gardens, regardless of the grade of the site.

### Responsible organisations and guidance

The register is kept by [Historic England](https://historicengland.org.uk/) with assistance from the [Gardens Trust](https://thegardenstrust.org/).
